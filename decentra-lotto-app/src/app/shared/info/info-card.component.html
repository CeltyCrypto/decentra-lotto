                                    The Ethereum lottery is extremely simple to save you on GAS - 
                                    there are no ticket purchases needed and you are automatically entered into lottery draws just by holding the DELO token on Ethereum.
                                    There is a minimum hold requirement of 82,000,000 DELO (0.1% of the supply) to be automatically entered into every draw. 
                                    If you hold less than this, you will not be in with a chance to win the jackpot.

                                    All you have to do to enter is buy and hold at least 82,000,000 DELO ETH, or bridge accross from BSC to ETH. 
                                    Draws happen automatically once the "Current Pot" has met the threshold "Next Draw At" above.
                                    Once this happens, Chainlink is used to fairly draw a winner from the DELO ETH token holders.
